# PWA-BUDGET

This is a budget app that is built using Node.js for the backend server and MongoDB for the database. The main purpose of this app is to help a user have access 
to the budget app even though they are in an area that doesn't provide access to the internet. I used a service worker to store the user data for offline access.
